# ML interpretor

machine learning interpretability as-a-service (work-in-progress)

## About

ML interpretor is a codeless environment to interpret why a decision is made by a supervised machine learning algorithm.

It operates at different levels:

- global: indicate the relation between important features and the target variable
- locally: understand the relation between a single row of records or small clusters of records and their corresponding predictions
